### Note for Google Chrome users:
This plugin is fully functional on Google Chrome, however I will not be publishing on the Chrome Web Store. This is because I disagree with the Developer Fee for submitting an open-source extension I have contributed to voluntarily. If you find any extension on the Chrome Web Store that claims to be this plugin, please be cautious when installing, as I did not publish it.
